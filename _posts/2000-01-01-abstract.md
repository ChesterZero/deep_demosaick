# Abstract
{: .text-purple}
 Modern digital cameras rely on sequential execution of  separate  image  processing  steps  to  produce  realistic  images. The  first  two  steps  are  usually  related  to  denoising  and  demosaicking where the former aims to reduce noise from the sensor and the latter converts a series of light intensity readings to color images.  Modern  approaches  try  to  jointly  solve  these  problems, i.e joint denoising-demosaicking which is an inherently ill-posed problem  given  that  two-thirds  of  the  intensity  information  are missing and the rest are perturbed by noise. While there are several machine learning systems that have been recently introduced to solve this problem, in this work we propose a novel algorithm which  is  inspired  by  powerful  classical  image  regularization methods, large-scale  optimization and  deep  learning techniques. Consequently, our derived neural network has a transparent and clear  interpretation  compared  to  other  black-box  data  driven approaches.  Our  extensive  experimentation  line  demonstrates that our proposed network outperforms any previous approaches on both noisy and noise-free data across many different datasets. This  improvement  in  reconstruction  quality  is  attributed  to  the principled  way  we  design  our  network  architecture,  which  as  a result requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the art solution and furthermore can be efficiently trained by using a significantly smaller number of training data than existing deep  demosaicking  networks.
